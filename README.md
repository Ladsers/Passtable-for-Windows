## Passtable
Portable Windows application for storing passwords and confidential data. Written in C# (WPF app). Recommended operating systems: Windows 11, Windows 10. Requires [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48)([direct download link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-offline-installer)) to run. Opens ".passtable" files.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ladsers/Passtable-for-Windows.git
```

### Features
ðŸ”¸ **Free & No ads** </br>
The application does not contain paid functions and advertising.

ðŸ”¸ **Strong AES encryption** </br>

ðŸ”¸ **File approach** </br>
Passtable stores data in separate files, and not in the application itself. The advantage of this approach is that data sets can exist independently of each other and, if necessary, can easily be moved to another device (including Android smartphone).

ðŸ”¸ **Quick data sorting** </br>
Add tags when creating elements in one touch, and then quickly find your data using them.

ðŸ”¸ **Log'n'Pass system** </br>
Automatic sequential copying of data to the clipboard for quick authentication on sites and applications.
